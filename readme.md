# Library App

A project for The Odin Project, more details [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/library).

This is a simple app that lets you add and remove books to a collection. All of the data is handled client-side with Javascript, and the information for the library is saved in local storage so it persists even when the page is closed or refreshed.
